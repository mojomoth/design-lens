## Log

- 2026-07-06 · harness scaffolding created; no build iterations have run yet.
- 2026-07-08 · T01 done: scaffolded plugin/cli (tsc strict, eslint flat, tsup, vitest) + lib/slug.
  Traps: vitest 3.2 `passWithNoTests`/`fileParallelism` are ROOT-only, NOT per-project (put them
  under `test:`, not inside a `projects[].test`). `new URL()` percent-encodes spaces in path
  segments, so a space in a slug fixture becomes `-20-`; use dash-safe URLs in slug tests.
  Kept deps to devDeps only (runtime deps land per-task per the plan); avoided `@eslint/js`
  (not allowlisted) by exporting a plain flat-config array with `tseslint.configs.recommended`.
- 2026-07-08 · T02 done: commander program factory `src/cli.ts` (pure, no parse/exit) + `src/version.ts`
  (`VERSION='0.1.0'`, single source of truth) + `src/index.ts` entry. Trap: commander LATEST (v14/v15)
  requires node>=22 (EBADENGINE on our node 20) — pin `commander@^12` (engines >=18). Test drives it
  in-process via `exitOverride()`+`configureOutput()`; `--version` throws CommanderError{exitCode:0}
  after writing. Did NOT `npm run build` (would create dist/ → flips B10 red pre-T11 per M1 invariant).
